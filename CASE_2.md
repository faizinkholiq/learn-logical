# Check if Every Row and Column Contains All Number

An n x n matrix is valid if every row and every column contains all the integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

Give an n x n integer matrix matrix, return true if the matrix is valid. Otherwise return false.

Example 1:

- Input: matrix = [[1,2,3], [3,1,2], [2,3,1]]
- Output: true
- Explanation: In this case, n = 3, and every row and column contains the number 1,2, and 3. Hence, we return true.
